== About me
I recieved my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer engineering and artificial intelligence from Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman Iran [http://www.uk.ac.ir (SBUK)] in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Since then, I've been working toward my Ph.D. degree under supervision of [https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/david-c-noelle Prof. David C. Noelle] in the computational cognitive neuroscience lab (CCNL) at University of California in Merced. I am interested in deep learning problems as well as their applications in computer vision. Mainly, my research has been focused on object localization and object detection on high resolution images. I am also interested in other machine learning problems like dimensionality reduction and ensemble learning. During my M.Sc. degree I have done some research in the field of combinatorial optimization with its application on feature selection. You may take a look at my brief [cv/Ebrahimpour-CV.pdf CV].
